The Elixir AI has enormous potential in the video game development sector, as it can significantly accelerate the process of creating 3D content by transforming 2D images and text prompts into high-quality 3D models. This allows developers to realize their ideas more quickly and focus on other aspects of the game, which is especially important in the face of growing competition in the market.\
\
Considering that the global video game market is valued at approximately $200 billion, and the content development segment accounts for about $60 billion, the potential for implementing tools like Elixir AI could reach several billion dollars. Given the increasing interest in automation and optimization processes in the gaming industry, Elixir AI has every chance of occupying a significant niche in this rapidly growing market.
