At this juncture, you may upload one or multiple two-dimensional images in either PNG or JPEG format. By clicking the "+" icon, you can select the desired files from your computer or mobile device.

Please note that the more images you incorporate at this stage, the greater the detail and intricacy of your resulting 3D model.

Following this, click the "Generate" button and await the completion of the process. The creation of your model may take up to 5 minutes if our servers are experiencing high traffic. Generally, the generation of a high-detail 3D model requires approximately 2-3 minutes. Should the process exceed 5 minutes, we recommend restarting it for optimal results.

If you wish to grant permission for your created 3D model to be featured in our promotional materials, kindly check the box labeled "Enable publication...." In this scenario, you will retain copyright ownership as the creator of the model.
