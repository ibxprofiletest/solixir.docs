Do you know how much time it takes to create a simple 3D character in the modern world? Even when using modern software like Blender, Autodesk Maya, ZBrush, and Marvelous Designer, a highly paid specialist will typically spend a lot of time to create simple 3d model.

• Simple character: 1–3 days.

• Medium level of detail: 1–2 weeks.

• High detail (for AAA games): 2–6 weeks or even more.

What if it were possible to reduce this time by several times, using only a concept drawn in two-dimensional space?
